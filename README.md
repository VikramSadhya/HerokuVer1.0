# HerokuVer1.0

This project aims to help recovery teams to locate people trapped in buildings after an earthquke using the power of Eddystone beacons. A web application developed in node.js is hosted on Heroku.com (a cloud hosting service provider). The beacons broadcasted a url (edy.herokuapp.com) to the web application through which the victims can log a message to a central database. The recovery team can use view these logs and reach the spots faster as they are aware of the victim's locations.
